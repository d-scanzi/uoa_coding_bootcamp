## About the day

*Intro*

|    1. What is [Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/)?
|    2. Why do we use it (and you should too)?
|    3. Possible alternatives

*Core*

|    1. Create a [mental rotation task](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Mental_rotation) with the GUI
|    2. Adding code
|    3. Basics of Python coding

## What is Psychopy

:::: columns

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/psychopy_logo.png)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
Psychopy is a software based on Python which allows you to create experiments. It is used primarily in ***psychology*** and ***neuroscience***. 
It currently counts almost 40.000 unique users.

## Alternatives

There are other commonly used experimental software out there, some of which might be used by people in your lab. Here is a breakdown of the most commonly used in our offices and how they features. Note, this is necessarily a biased list.

# Mental Rotation Task

::: {.column width="40%"}
Originally developed by [Shepard and Metzler (1971)](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.171.3972.701), it is still today one of the most commonly used task to investigate the cognitive manipulation of mental images.

Are the two objects the same?

## Mental Rotation Task

:::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/shepard_metzler_results.png)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
Reaction times increase linearly with the increase in the rotation angle of the two objects

## What we will create today

::: {.column width="50%"}
We will create a 2D version of the original task, with letters as stimuli. We will manipulate

<ul>
  <li>Rotation angle</li>
  <li>Letter equality</li>
</ul>
