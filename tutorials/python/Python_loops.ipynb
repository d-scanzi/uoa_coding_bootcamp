    "Let's unpack what's happening here. First, we tell Python that we are running a for-loop stating `for name in friends:`. This tells explicitly that we want to iterate over all the values stored in the list `friends`. Then, we have the **body** of the loop, which is the lines of code that should be run for each value in our list. In Python, the body of a loop must always be indented (one indentation) after the line that starts the loop. Moreover, when creating a loop, you need to use a column (:) at the end of the first line.\n",

    "As you can see, we have used a new variable not defined before, `name`. This variable is there as a placeholder for each value we iterate over. In other words, Python starts by extracting the first value from the list (first name) and assigns this to the variable `name`. The body of the loop is executed with the current value stored in `name`. When all the code lines in the loop body are executed, the second iteration begins. Now, Python will update the variable `name`, assigning it the second value stored in `friends`. Then, it runs the body with this new value. This cycle continues until all the values in `friends` have been used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because `name` is a placeholder, we can call this variable as we want. Indeed, you will see that people often write something like `for i in friends` or `for k in friends` and so on. In this case, `i` or `k` are exactly the same as our `name`; a placeholder variable whose value is updated for every iteration. To prove this, let's run the same code replacing `name` with something else"

Firstly, the list created by range starts at 0 and ends one number before the value you passed (10 instead of 11).

In general terms, if you want to iterate over the values of a list/tuples, then use the first method we showed (`for i in variable_name`). Instead, if you want to repeat some steps multiple times, use `range` (`for i in range()`). Note, however, that the second method can be used to replace the first by combining loops with accessing elements of a list. If we write something like `for i in range(10)`, we know that `i` will assume values from 1 to 9, one value for each iteration. Thus, we can exploit this to index the first ten elements of an object like a list, tuple or string. "

The condition is always a true-or-false statement. The result of `current_result >= T` is either `True` or `False`. Thus, the `while-loop` performs `current_result >= T` and if the result is `True`, it keeps going. If the result is `False`, it stops looping. Because of this, it is common to find loops with statements like `while True:`. Because a `while-loop` runs as long as the statement is `True`, such a loop would run forever. Indeed, when you find loops starting with something like `while True:`, look inside their body. You should see a line that says `break` or something similar.
