Welcome to this experiment and thank you for deciding to participate!
In this study you will see two letters presented one on the left and the other on the right side of the screen. Your job is to decide whether they are the same letters or not
To do this you need to mentally rotate the letter on the left to try to match the one on the right. Sometimes the letters are a mirrored version of each other and they cannot be matched with a simple rotation
If the letters match (are the same) press the A key. If they do not match (mirrored) press the L key.
